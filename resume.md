Tomer Filiba (<tomerfiliba@gmail.com>) | Tel Aviv, Israel

## General ##

I am the author of several well-known [Python](http://python.org) open source projects, 
including [RPyC](http://rpyc.sf.net) (transparent, symmetric remoting solution for Python), 
[Construct](http://construct.wikispaces.com) (declarative interdependent data structures), 
and [Plumbum](http://plumbum.readthedocs.org) (shell-combinators for Python).

## Expertise ##
I'm an expert **Python** developer, and well experienced in **C**, **C++**, **Java**, **C#** and 
related technologies and design patterns. I'm familiar with both **Linux** and **Windows**, from 
low-level APIs to higher ones, and have extensive knowledge of the inner-workings of kernels, 
networks and network programming, file systems, and the storage (SCSI) world. I especially excel
in **software design and architecture**, **automating** the mundane, designing domain-specific 
languages, and finding creative solutions to problems.

I'm familiar with web-development ([django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and others), and I'm
beginning my way with Android mobile applications. 

## Education ##
[Tel Aviv University](http://english.tau.ac.il/), 2009-2012. BA (cum laude) in Computer Science 
and Linguistics, with a focus on *Computational Linguistics*. 

## Employment ##
[IBM XIV](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/xiv/), January 2008 - August 2012.
Developed QA infrastructure tools for complex test environments, involving many hardware devices
of all sorts. I also served as a focal point for design questions and programming best-practices.
