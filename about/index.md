I'm Tomer Filiba, 27 years old, living in Tel Aviv, Israel. I graduated in 2012 from Tel Aviv
University, where I studied Computer Science and Generative Linguistics. I am a long-time Python 
developer and the author of multiple open source Python projects, most notable of which are 
[RPyC](http://rpyc.sf.net), [Construct](http://construct.wikispaces.com) and 
[Plumbum](http://plumbum.readthedocs.org).

My areas of research include [domain specific languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
(mostly in the form of intra-language [combinators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic)),
automatic [deduction of user interface]((http://tomerfiliba.com/blog/Deducible-UI)), transparent
networking and RPC and [coroutine-based](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/microactor#microactor-untwist-your-code)
parallelization. I am also interested in computational models and their expressive power, abstract
algebra, advanced type systems and logics.

On my less geeky-side, I enjoy (at no particular order) history and fiction books, exploring
the world, growing flowerpots, good beer and wine, music, wandering for hours on Wikipedia and 
my lovely wife. This site is both my personal homepage and professional blog, so don't be 
surprised to find a mix of technical posts next to opinions or the occasional venting.

## Freelance & Consulting Services ##
As of September 2012, I am a freelance developer, offering software/web development and consulting 
services. I work mainly within Israel (either in-office or from home), but I take contracting jobs 
from overseas as well. My specialties include software design and system architecture, automation
and testing tools, and server-side programming. 

I am also available for giving Python and design lectures/courses, ranging from beginners' level 
to very advanced topics (probably only relevant within Israel).
