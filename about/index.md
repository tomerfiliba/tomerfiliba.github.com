I'm Tomer Filiba, 28 years old, living in Tel Aviv, Israel. I graduated in 2012 from Tel Aviv
University, where I studied Computer Science and Generative Linguistics. I am a long-time Python 
developer and the author of multiple open source Python projects, most notable of which are 
[RPyC](http://rpyc.sf.net), [Construct](http://construct.readthedocs.org) and 
[Plumbum](http://plumbum.readthedocs.org).

My areas of research include [domain specific languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
(mostly in the form of intra-language [combinators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic)),
automatic [deduction of user interface](http://tomerfiliba.com/blog/Deducible-UI), transparent
networking and RPC and [coroutine-based](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/microactor#microactor-untwist-your-code)
parallelization. I am also interested in computational models and their expressive power, abstract
algebra, advanced type systems and logics.

On my less geeky-side, I enjoy (at no particular order) history and fiction books, exploring
the world, growing herbs and a small avocado tree in flowerpots, good beer and wine, music, 
wandering for hours on Wikipedia and my lovely wife. This site is both my personal homepage and 
professional blog, so don't be surprised to find a mix of technical posts next to opinions or the 
occasional venting.
