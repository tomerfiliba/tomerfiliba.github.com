<h1>Hi There</h1>
<p>
I'm Tomer Filiba, a <a href="http://goo.gl/uZuisr">freelancing</a> software expert and author of numerous 
<a href="http://goo.gl/y9Rwe0">open source</a> projects, most notable of which are <a href="http://goo.gl/U8iiWL">RPyC,</a> 
<a href="http://goo.gl/Ytd5x8">Construct</a> and <a href="http://goo.gl/DD50AN">Plumbum</a>. 
I mess mostly with Python, but my skill set ranges from low-level, resource-constrained environments
to large-scale servers, and from the mechanics of computers, networks and kernels to 
the more theoretical aspects of algorithms or advanced type systems.
</p><p>
This is my personal site and <a href="/blog">blog</a>, where I write about my work, open source projects 
and even politics (occasionally, don't get scared <i class="icon-emo-happy"></i>).
</p><p>
I'm currently doing projects for several companies, which keep me busy, but feel free to 
<a href="mailto:contact@tomerfiliba.com">contact me</a> regarding projects or job opportunities,
as well as my open source project. You can find out more about what I do in the <a href="/about">about page</a>.
