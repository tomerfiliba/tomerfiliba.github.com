I'm pretty much overbooked with my day-job, university, and life in general, but I might be 
available for *interesting* consulting jobs. I excel in the design and architecture of projects 
of all scales, over a range of platforms and programming languages, especially in Python. 
I can also provide extensive support and customization of my open-source projects, for a fee.

By the way, I'm also giving a course called *Advance Python Topics*, aimed at small groups
of experienced programmers, which covers all sorts of more-advanced and less widely-known 
aspects of Python and design in general (this is probably only relevant within Israel).

Oh, and web development is *not* my cup of tea :)

Feel free to contact me at <tomerfiliba@gmail.com> regarding any such positions.
