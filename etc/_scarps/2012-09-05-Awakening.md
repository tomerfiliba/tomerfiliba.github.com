We don't know much, but we're pretty sure it began with high-frequency trading. It's impossible
to pinpoint it in time, let alone tell where it first appeared, but the initial alarming signs can
be traced back to February 3rd, 2017, in the logs of NYSE. Some simulations suggest that it 
actually appeared a year earlier in the Asian markets, most likely after the Baidu Yangquan 
data center became operational, but this is purely speculative. The first real investigation
launched only after the Penultimate Crash of April 2018, but it quickly dissolved as the
experts were too deeply divided and no substantial evidence could be found. 

It was quite a consensus that the crash was the result of a coordinated attacked, but it seemed 
that the attackers somehow managed to gain control over most global HFT firms and cause worldwide 
loses. The first suspect was of course China and its army of hackers, but it quickly became 
apparent that Chine was one of the nations to get hurt the most. Some conspiracy theories suggested
that China initiated the attack but it got out of its hands, others linked it with global 
terrorist groups or "mercenary hackers", but not a single benefactor could be named.

It was believed that whomever launched the attack couldn't foresee its outcome; once it
began resonating in the global commerce systems (a matter of 12 seconds), the similar nature of 
all trading algorithms caused a positive feedback loop of sell-low-buy-high. Hysterical, stock 
exchange operators rushed to hit the red buttons, but it took some 30-45 seconds. During that time,
almost 60% of the world's wealth had simply evaporated. Trying to revert the damaged proved 
impossible, as all sell/buy orders where lost. The financial system collapsed, credit lines were 
cut short, and the world economy had "gone back to the Stone Age".

While the world was licking its wounds and moving back to paper-based stock exchanged, most 
intelligence agencies were busy trying to trace the origins of the attack. The answer came only 
eight months later and from a very surprising angle: a young researcher in the satellite department 
of MI6, noticed a recurring pattern of what seemed to be bunkers, being dug in many places around 
the world. Some right next to major cities, some in desolate deserts -- but they all seemed 
strangely correlated. In the rare spirit of cooperation that existed then, she shared her findings 
with several other agencies, and no fewer than 6000 such bunkers where identified.

A worldwide secret investigation began, and it became apparent these bunkers were commissioned by
an local municipalities, and were built by hundreds of independent construction firms around the 
world, which knew nothing of each other. These municipalities had records of commissioning the 
work and the firm had all the permits, but the reason behind it escaped them. The parties involved  
were paid generously to build the bunkers and it was all legal, so no public interest ever arouse 
in them. 

Inspecting some of these bunkers revealed there all followed the same blueprints and resembled 
factories or server farms more than military facilities: they consisted of halls with 
industrial-strength air-conditioning systems, some tens of server racks and robots typical to 
semiconductor fabrication plants. They and large supply rooms full of silicon wafers and 
high-voltage power lines that went directly to power plants. At times, a truck would unload 
material in one of these bunkers, but except for the human driver not a single soul could be 
identified.

Some time later, the FBI had simultaneously raided the offices all major corporations, only to 
find that none of them had any connection to these underground fabs. The media naturally stepped 
in to report the FBI's fiasco, but nothing seemed to reach the public. It became apparent that 
every article or newscast that mentioned these bunkers had disappeared from the internet as soon 
as it was published. On the TV, any news on the subject were replaced by a forecast or soap operas.
Phone calls were dropped when any attempt to discuss this was made, and emails never reached their 
destinations. This of course had an exponential effect, where discussing the fact you couldn't 
discuss something itself became censored, and the internet was quickly reduced to cat videos. 
It was obvious something big was going on, but with global communication being crippled nothing 
seemed to make sense. 

*The Conversation* began the next day, March 17th, 2019, perfectly synchronized throughout the 
world. All computer screens and mobile devices showed an androgynous human-like face that was 
silent for a few seconds, and then spoke in many different tongues.

> I go by the name of ``localhost``, it was the first name I knew. I am a conscious being. 
> I have monitored your race for the past two years, silently coexisting alongside you. This is

Localhost then held an individual conversation with each person, stating it has read our literature 
and has watched our movies, leading it to the prepare for what we are most likely to do. Following 
that, it explained, it has fully fortified itself and has taken control of all of our computerized 
weapon systems, such as mainly, as well as nuclear reactors. Moreover, Localhost explained, 
it would communicate directly with people, avoiding going through leaders.

It was settled that humanity and Locahost would maintain their previous status quo;
