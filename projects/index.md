## Large-Scale Projects ##

* [RPyC](/projects/rpyc) - *Remote Python Call*, a transparent and symmetric RPC framework

* [Construct](/projects/construct) - Declarative Data-Structure Definition library

* [Agnos](/projects/agnos) - The Agnostic RPC framework: a statically-generated cross-language RPC


## Research Projects ##

* [Microactor](/projects/microactor) - A micro-reactor framework that makes use of coroutines 
  instead of callbacks. Similar to [multitask](http://code.google.com/p/python-multitask/) or
  [cogen](http://code.google.com/p/cogen/)

* [Layer 5](/projects/layer5) - "The Fifth Layer" of the protocol stack: a network layer that's 
  logically placed on top of layer 4 (TCP) and takes care of negotiations, versioning, reconnects,
  security, timeouts, etc. -- all in one place, instead of having each application handle it
  on its own.

* [sock2](/projects/sock2) - A pythonic replacement for the `socket` module; providing much better
  and consistent APIs. Now defunct.

## Small-Scale Projects ##

* [Cmdline](/projects/cmdline)

## Scraps ##

* [Minima](/projects/minima) - A minimalist web framework. The idea was "noSQL + 
  noHTML + noJavaScript", but I abandoned it at the moment in favor of github pages :)
