## Large-Scale Projects ##

* [RPyC](http://rpyc.sf.net) - *Remote Python Call*, a transparent and symmetric RPC framework

* [Construct](http://construct.wikispaces.com) - Declarative Data-Structure Definition library

* [Agnos](http://agnos.sf.net) - The Agnostic RPC framework: a statically-generated cross-language RPC

## Small-Scale Projects ##

* [Cmdline](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/cmdline) - A command-line toolkit that provides both 
  sides of the coin: easy parsing of command-line switches (like `optparse` and `argparse`, 
  but much nicer), and the easy invocation of command-line programs as if they were functions
  (like [pbs](https://github.com/amoffat/pbs), but offering a cleaner approach)

## Research Projects ##

* [Microactor](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/microactor) - A micro-reactor framework that makes use of coroutines 
  instead of callbacks. Similar to [multitask](http://code.google.com/p/python-multitask/) or
  [cogen](http://code.google.com/p/cogen/)

* [Layer 5](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/layer5) - "The Fifth Layer" of the protocol stack: a network layer that's 
  logically placed on top of layer 4 (TCP) and takes care of negotiations, versioning, reconnects,
  security, timeouts, etc. -- all in one place, instead of having each application handle it
  on its own.

## Scraps ##

* [sock2](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/sock2) - A pythonic replacement for the `socket` module; 
  providing much better and consistent APIs. Now defunct.

* [Minima](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/minima) - A minimalist web framework. The idea was "noSQL + 
  noHTML + noJavaScript", but I abandoned it at the moment in favor of github pages :)
