It's been a while since I last blogged... sorry! I had a midterm exam, a seminar project to deliver 
(an `O(n^3)` parser for [Tree Insertion Grammar](http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J95/J95-4002.pdf)),
the routine family festivities of Passover, and this new thing, *Plumbum*, that has been keeping 
my mind overclocked while I should have been studying and writing seminar papers. But now that it's
out, it's about time I write a little on it.

So [Plumbum](http://plumbum.readthedocs.org/) is something I've toyed with for quite some time now.
In almost any sort of project, there comes a time when you have to write this really simple, 
5-liner shell script, just to build your project's artifacts, maybe also upload them to PyPI
or sourceforge (using `rsync`), and why not build the project's documentation while you're at it.
Oh, and don't forget to run regression tests before all that, and it would be wise to also handle
some basic command-line options, as you might want to skip uploading to PyPI at times, or build
on different versions of python... and then you end up with this monstrous, hideous shell script
that you wrote (or worst, some former employee wrote) and you never want to lay your eyes on 
again... and you hate yourself for not doing it in python to begin with.

But then again, how do you translate `find . -name "*.pyc" | xargs rm` or `cp */*.py /tmp` 
to python? That would take quite a few lines and require importing several modules. Shell scripts
tend to be so short and enchanting... How do we bridge the gap? 

Plumbum was born to fill this very gap: on the one hand, be pythonic (and be backed by strong 
libraries), and on the other, make it all as easy and one-liner-ish by nature: use a **real
programming language**, with a well-behaved object model and high level concepts, to achieve what 
you'd normally do in a shell script, with the same expressive power and wrist-handiness
of the shell. I call it *shell combinators*, as they mimic shell syntax, but keep you pythonic.

Plumbum is actually a collection of utilities that I wrote for several separate projects, but the
time has come to consolidate them into a single, production-grade library. The library provides
local and remote program execution, with support for piping and IO redirection; local and remote
file-system path abstraction; a programmatic command-line interface (CLI) toolkit, and numerous
other utilities.

For instance, 

{%highlight python%}
from plumbum import local
from plumbum.cmd import wc, ls, echo, grep
from plumbum.utils import copy, delete

delete(local.cwd // "*/*.pyc")

for fn in local.cwd / "src" // "*.py":
    print wc("-l", fn)

num_of_src_lines = (ls["-l"] | grep["\\.py"] | wc["-l"])()

echo["1"] > "/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward")() 
{%endhighlight%}

There's a [short cheat-sheet and extensive documentation](http://plumbum.readthedocs.org/) on the
project's site, but I'd like to elaborate a bit on the 
[CLI toolkit](http://plumbum.readthedocs.org/en/latest/cli.html), as I think it deserves some more
attention. Instead of building a parser object and populating it with options in an imperative
manner, the CLI toolkit offers a more **declarative** yet programmatic alternative: An application
is defined as a class that derives from `cli.Application`; it may defines a `main()` method,
which serves as the "entry point" of the application, and any number of **switch-methods**, meaning,
methods that are invokable from the command-line.

Switch methods are normal methods, decorated by ``@switch``, that may take zero or one arguments;
for each switch given on the command line, the toolkit will invoke the switch method that binds it.
Similarly, the `main()` method is invoked after all switches have been processed, and it takes
all the *positional arguments* (i.e., non-switch arguments) that were given. And last but not least,
there are *switch attributes*, which are in fact just specialized versions of switch functions, 
that store an argument given to the switch in an instance attribute.

Oh my, I've probably only gotten you confused by now, but I had to introduce the terminology. 
Real usage of the toolkit is much simpler! 

{%highlight python%}
from plumbum import cli

class MyHttpServer(cli.Application):
    log_to_file = cli.SwitchAttr("--log-to-file", str)
    verbose = cli.Flag("-v")
    mode = cli.SwitchAttr("--mode", cli.Set("TCP", "UDP"), default = "TCP")
    port = cli.SwitchAttr("--port", cli.Range(1024, 65535), default = 8080)
    
    @switch(["-l", "--load-config"], cli.ExistingFile)
    def load_config(self, filename):
        """Loads the given config file"""
        f = open(filename, "r")
        # ...
    
    def main(self, src, dst):
        if self.log_to_file:
            logger.addHandler(FileHandler(self.log_to_file))
        logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG if self.verbose else logging.WARNING)
        # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    MyHttpServer.run()
{%endhighlight%}

There, I think it's a lovely example of the expressive power of the CLI toolkit and Plumbum in 
general. I hope you'll give it a try, and may you never have to write shell scripts again!
