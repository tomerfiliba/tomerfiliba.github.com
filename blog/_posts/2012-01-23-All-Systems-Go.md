At last, I finished migrating the old `drupal` site to github pages. Everything is now fully
revisioned and statically-generated (using Disqus for comments). Jekyll is so cool! I wrote all
the HTML and forged the stylesheets myself... hope you like it.

Anyhow, I'm happy with the design now, and I'll start blogging more regularly. I still have
plenty of pages to complete (projects, about-page, etc.), and a few partially-written blogs
posts to polish up, but other generally speaking, we're up.

If you have any feedback about the design/site, please let me know in the comments below or
via email. Thanks!
