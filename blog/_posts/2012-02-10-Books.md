After the CS secretariat refused to let take math courses as electives (thus forcing me into taking
boring stuff like SQL), I think [Dover](http://store.doverpublications.com/by-subject-science-and-mathematics-mathematics.html) 
books and I are going to become good friends. It's not like I have plenty of time to read them,
but even just seeing them on my bookshelf would make me a happier person :)

Next on my wish-list are some books on logics and proof theory, category theory, information theory,
and automata and computability. I'll get there some day...
