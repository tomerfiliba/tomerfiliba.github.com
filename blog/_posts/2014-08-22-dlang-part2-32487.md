1. No, "Dlang Dlang uber Alles" was not meant to be offensive or avert the discussion by means of 
[pulling a Godwin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law). Yes, I was aware of the context.
I'm Jewish. I just liked the sound of it and found it funny. My sincere apologies to anyone who
felt offended by this.

2. My post reached a wider audience than I anticipated, which is kind of cool, given the circumstances.
And even more surprisingly, the reactions (at the ones I've seen on 
[reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2e49tm/d_for_the_win/)) were on-topic.
I'm used to bashing and people just missing the point, but it seems I really did get 

3. Sorry, I've never heard of [Nimrod](http://nimrod-lang.org/) until now. If I had, I'd surely 
try it out. But the product I'm working on is already committed to D at this point, and from what

4. Some people said that *system programming* is anything that's run natively (i.e., not in a VM).
That's not the definition I'm using. 

5. The C10K problem moved people from thread-per-IO to asynchronous IO (`epoll`, `kqueue`, `IOCP`, etc)
  in few threads. The C10M problem moves IO from the kernel into userland. You simply can't process enough
  packages when you have several system calls per IO. Context switches are expansive, the kernel requires
  accounting on its own, and you don't get to utilize hardware offloading when you go through the standard 
  network stacks. For instance, I got a factor 12 improvement when I moved my
