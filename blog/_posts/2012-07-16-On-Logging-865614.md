In the third part of the series, I want to address *logging*, especially when it intersects with
exceptions and exception handling.


, logging and
exceptions, and style.

## Logging ##


* What to log
* Where to log
* Avoid excessive logging
* Use exceptions
* include add info in exception itself, rather than log
* Oreror




## Style != Beauty ##

Lastly, I wanted to point out that **coding style is not just about looks**. Many people think that
style is a matter of individual preference; it might be true, but it usually reflects 

if x in somedict.keys()
if kwargs.keys()[0] == 'foo'

try:
    x
except:
    raise

self.MUST_BE_SINGLE_PATH is True

## A Rant On ``logging`` ##

In the first installment, I argued that Python's ``logging`` module suffers from extensive 
Javaisms, which sparked a long discussion in the comments. Vinay Sajip argued that albeit 
``logging`` "borrows" from [log4j](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j), it makes *easy tasks simple 
and hard tasks possible*. But let's face it - how can logging ever be *hard*? The hardest it gets 
is opening a file and appending lines to it! It's far from rocket science, so the most important 
part is its software engineering.

Back in the day, a friend of mine coined the derogatory term **oreror**, to refer to "every 
programming-related concept that ends with -er or -or", such as ``Container`` or ``Visitor``. 
He wasn't referring to Java in particular, but Java lends itself to a great deal of such orerors,
because of the way its OOP system works: it requires so many mediat*or* and adapt*er* objects 
everywhere. Now pop up a Python interpreter, import ``logging`` and type ``help(logging)``. 
This is what you'll see in the first few lines:

    CLASSES
        __builtin__.object
            BufferingFormatter
            Filter
            Formatter
            LogRecord
            LoggerAdapter
        Filterer(__builtin__.object)
            Handler
                NullHandler
                StreamHandler
                    FileHandler
            Logger

They f**king even have ``Filterer`` - try to top that! 

Here's an attempt to outline a *Pythonic* logging framework. A logger
