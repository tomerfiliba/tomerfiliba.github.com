I first heard of the [D Programming Language](http://dlang.org/) around 2002. Back in the day, I was eagerly
trying to invent new languages with idiotic syntaxes and all sorts of crazy ideas. I was young and passionate and 
totally inexperienced. But those were fun times. I recalled this when I read the introduction to 
[Alexandrescu'S](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Alexandrescu) book, *The D Programming Language*:

> Walter Bright, a C and C++ compiler writer, [...] set out to define a language as he thought "it should be done."
> Many of us dream at some point dream at some point of defining the Right Language [...]

So I had this *warm fuzzy feeling* &trade; to start with. Three weeks and 5000 LoC later, I decided to write 
down my experience so far with the language. Clearly such a short while isn't enough to draw meaningful 
conclusions from, but I wish to share what little experience I already have because I have feeling has value 
on its own.
