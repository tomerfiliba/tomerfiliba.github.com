I recently got back to web development for some venture I'm working on, which reminded me just how
shitty the state of the art is. There's no nice way to put it: **we're doing web development all 
wrong**. It's not an anecdotal thing I have against this or that -- it's every facet of it. It's a 
stack of inferior technologies, held together by the forces of time, and the sad thing is, they are 
here to stay. Nobody's gonna kill HTTP or JavaScript, not even Google, at least not in the 
foreseeable future. It's a hand we have to play.
