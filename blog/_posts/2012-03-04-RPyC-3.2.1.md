This is a maintenance release, fixing some minor bugs and resolving some issues with Python 3 
compatibility. More on the [change log](http://rpyc.sourceforge.net/changelog.html).

Python 2.x: it's *advisable* to upgrade to this version.

Python 3.x: it's **highly recommended** to upgrade to this version, as it resolves some core
issues that went under the radar in 3.2.0.
