This is a maintenance release, fixing some issues concerning introspection, ``ForkingServer`` 
and signals, IronPython and signals, and SSH on Windows. It also introduces optional logging 
of exceptions that occur over the RPyC connection to the server's logger (or any other logger
instance, given in the connection's configuration). The 
[change log](http://rpyc.sourceforge.net/changelog.html) has more details.

**Note:** This is the last release of the 3.2 branch. Future releases (of the 3.3 branch) will 
require [plumbum](http://plumbum.readthedocs.org), thus the SSH support will be removed from the
codebase. The next version will also provide [zero-deploy](https://github.com/tomerfiliba/rpyc/issues/81),
which will make RPyC much easier to use. This release is expected in September.
