I'm a convert. I've seen the light. You see, Python is nice and all, and it excels in so many domains, 
but when you take it out of the lab and into the real world, you get the feeling the price you pay 
is just too high. Literally. You burn too much memory and CPU cycles doing very little work... 
and there are times you just can't afford it.

The [C10M problem](http://c10m.robertgraham.com/p/manifesto.html) is a reiteration of the 
[C10K problem](http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html). In short, today's hardware can handle millions 
of packets per second, but in reality you hardly ever reach these numbers. For instance, 
I worked a short while at a company that used AWS and had lots Python servers accepting requests 
and logging them, not doing any actual work. They used `twisted` and managed to squeeze ~500 requests/sec.
Moving to PyPy (not without discomfort) tripled the numbers or so, but still, the cost simply didn't scale.

Python, I love you, but you help instill [Gate's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth's_law) --
"The speed of software halves every 18 months". In the end, we pay for our CPU cycles and we want to 
maximize our profit. It's not you, Guido, it's me. I've moved on to tackle the C10M world, and for that
I would need a programming language that's designed for **system programming**, with a strong and flexible 
**type system** (after all, I love duck typing), where ease of customization is a plus.

I've looked at [rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) (but it's far from stable enough for a large project), 
[go](http://golang.org/) (they must be joking if they really consider it for system programming), and I've 
finally found peace with [D](http://dlang.org/).
