I'm a convert! I've seen the light!

You see, Python is nice and all, and it excels in so many domains,
but when you take it out of the lab and into the real world, you get the feeling the price you pay
is just too high. Literally. You burn too much memory and CPU cycles doing very little work...
and there are times you just can't afford it.

The [C10M problem](http://c10m.robertgraham.com/p/manifesto.html) is a reiteration of the
[C10K problem](http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html). In short, today's hardware can handle millions
of packets per second, but in reality you hardly ever reach these numbers. For instance,
I worked a short while at a company that used AWS and had lots Python servers accepting requests
and logging them, not doing any actual work. They used `twisted` and managed to squeeze ~500 requests/sec.
Moving to PyPy (not without discomfort) tripled the numbers or so, but still, the cost simply didn't scale.

Python, I love you, but you help instill [Gate's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth's_law) --
"The speed of software halves every 18 months". In the end, we pay for our CPU cycles and we want to
maximize our profit. It's not you, Guido, it's me. I've moved on to the C10M world, and for that
I'd need a programming language that's designed for **system programming** with a strong and flexible
**type system** (after all, I love duck typing). I need to interface with external systems,
so a C ABI is desirable (no foreign function interface), and ease of customization is a plus.

I've looked at [rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) (nice, but will require a couple of years to mature enough
for a large-scale project), [go](http://golang.org/) (they must be joking if they actually consider it
for system programming), and at last, I've finally found peace with [D](http://dlang.org/).

System programming is an endless topic with all sorts of constraints imposed by your specific environment,
which brings up all sorts o weird issues and problems to tackle. In other words, boring.
Instead of writing a post about how D serves me in that, I'd rather show how **D speaks fluent Python**.

But first things first. In (the probable) case you don't know much D -- imagine it's what C++ would have
wished to be. It offers better syntax, much faster compilation time, optional garbage collection, highly
expressive templates and type inference, Pythonic operator overloading (by *rewriting* the expression),
object-oriented and functional (multi-paradigm like Python), intermingles high-level constructs with
low-level ones (naked function in inline assembly) to produces efficient code, has compile-time
introspection capabilities and some extra cools features in the domain of code generation:
`mixin` -- which evaluates an arbitrary string of D code at compile time, and `CTFE` -- compile-time
function execution.

I'm not going to cover *everything* I've just said here, suffice it to say D has that
*cosy Python feeling* (TM). In other words, as long as you're interfacing with the compiler,
you

In general, D follows Python's duck-typing (or protocol-oriented) spirit. If a type provides the
necessary interface ("protocol") for an operation, it will work, and you can test for conformance
at compile time. For example, *ranges* are a generalization of Python's generators. All you need to do in order to
be an `InputRange` is implement `bool empty()`, `void popFront()` and `auto front()`, and you can use
`isInputRange!T` to test whether `T` answers the protocol. By the way, the excalmation point (`!`) stands for
compile-time arguments. There's a clear separation of what's compile-time and what's runtime.

## Some Examples ##

{% highlight d %}
import std.stdio;
import std.datetime;

struct Person {
    string name;
    Date birthDate;
    Person* spouse;

    string toString() {
        auto s = "Person(";
        /* this is dir(self) */
        foreach (i, name; __traits(allMembers, Person)) {
            s ~= name ~ "=" ~ this.tupleof[i] ~ ", ";
        }
        return s[0 .. $-2] ~ ")";
    }
}

auto p1 = Person("barack", Date(1970, 3, 4));
auto p2 = Person("michelle", Date(1975, 8, 1));
static this() {
    p1.spouse = &p2;
    p2.spouse = &p1;
}

void main() {
    writeln(p1);
}
