I'm a convert. I've seen the light! You see, Python is nice and all, and it excels in so many domains, 
but when you take it out of the lab and into the real world, you get the feeling the price you pay 
is just too high. Literally. You burn too much memory and CPU cycles doing very little work... 
and there are times you just can't afford it.

The [C10M problem](http://c10m.robertgraham.com/p/manifesto.html) is a reiteration of the 
[C10K problem](http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html). In short, today's hardware can handle millions 
of packets per second, but in reality you hardly ever reach these numbers. For instance, 
I worked a short while at a company that used AWS and had lots Python servers accepting requests 
and logging them, not doing any actual work. They used `twisted` and managed to squeeze ~500 requests/sec.
Moving to PyPy (not without discomfort) tripled the numbers or so, but still, the cost simply didn't scale.

Python, I love you, but you help instill [Gate's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth's_law) --
"The speed of software halves every 18 months". In the end, we pay for our CPU cycles and we want to 
maximize our profit. It's not you, Guido, it's me. I've moved on to the C10M world, and for that
I'd need a programming language that's designed for **system programming** with a strong and flexible 
**type system** (after all, I love duck typing). I need to interface with the external systems, 
so a C ABI is desirable, and ease of customization is a plus.

I've looked at [rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) (but it's far from stable enough for a large project), 
[go](http://golang.org/) (they must be joking if they really consider it for system programming), and I've 
finally found peace with [D](http://dlang.org/).

## Dlang Dlang Ãœber Alles ##

System programming covers a vast amount of topics, issues and bears all sorts of caveats. 
In other words, boring. Instead of writing a post about how D excels in that, I'd rather
show how D speaks fluent Python.

But first things first. In (the probable) case you don't much know D -- imagine it's what C++ would have 
wanted to be. It offers better syntax, much faster compilation time, optional garbage collection, highly
expressive templates and type inference, Pythonic operator overloading (by *rewriting* the expression)
and some extra cools features in the domain of code generation:
`mixin` -- which evaluates a string of D code at compile time, and compile-time function execution (CTFE).

In general, D follows Python's duck-typing (or protocol-oriented) spirit. If a type provides the 
necessary interface ("protocol"), it will work, and you can test for conformance at compile time.
For example, `ranges` are a generalization of Python's generators. All you need to do in order to 
be an `InputRange` is implement `bool empty(); void popFront(); auto front();`, and you can use
`isInputRange!T` to test whether `T` answers the protocol.
