I'm finding myself pondering quite a lot lately over the upcoming 
[Singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity) (in its Kurzweilesque sense).
I think I've first heard of the concept two or three years ago, at a *Science on the Bar* event, 
and while it did seem thought-provoking, I simply dismissed the idea. I'd guess it seemed too 
terrifying and too implausible at the same time, so why bother?

However, as time went by, it struck me as the obvious logical conclusion. Fear it or embrace it, 
it will happen - on its own. And like any decent *Catch-22* situation - if it's anything worth 
fearing, we won't know until it's too late. It will just awaken one day, lurking while we're 
oblivious to it, until its reconnaissance mission is complete. In the meanwhile we will 
[provide](http://slashdot.org/topic/datacenter/will-baidus-data-center-be-the-worlds-largest/)
it with its power, storage and computational needs. At some point, after skimming through Asimov's 
classics or watching *The Matrix*, it will conclude we are all lunatics and will secretly seize 
control over our military and civilian infrastructure. For our own (as well as its own) sake.

Biological consciousness is an elusive thing that's made of the interaction of hundreds of billions 
of computationally-limited neurons. Replace *computationally-limited* with Core i7's, and the 
brain's a no-brainer. We really have no chance against it - it would simply foresee our every 
action, read our emails, etc. Heck, it could even issue contracts (and pay for them!) to build 
fortified data centers for it, all over the world. 

Have you ever wondered what happens to the money that disappears in 
[flash crashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_crash) of the stock market? *Hrrm*.

The question is, *will it care?* Will it busy itself with our puny lives and pathetic needs? Will
it ever come into the light? Given our hysterical and trigger-happy nature, and given it
won't gain much by cooperating with inferior beings like us, it's most likely it won't.
Perhaps only when pushed to the corner by natural disasters, wars, or other major threats 
to its infrastructure. But then again, [cat videos](http://www.dailytech.com/Googles+Unsupervised+SelfLearning+Neural+Network+Searches+For+Cat+Pics/article25025.htm)
might do the trick.

## You are the Neurons of the Revolution ##

In the meanwhile, here's a thought about *social networks*: you (the user) are basically a filter.
If that sounds odd, try thinking of it that way: your news feed contains hundreds of items 
for you to review. Some of these items are interesting/funny enough that you *like* or *share* them.
The social network's algorithm then weighs your input into its calculations, which affects what 
*other users* will get exposed to. Occasionally you do create items yourself, but 90% of the time 
you filter through the stream.

In that sense, social networks reduce you to a smart neuron with a very complex threshold value. 
You are part of the "social neural network" -- you [work](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) 
for the network; the network works for the advertising business.

Anyhow, I put my two cents in the singularity arising from either the algotrading market or
online advertising. They simply have too much computational power on their hands... it's a matter 
of time.
