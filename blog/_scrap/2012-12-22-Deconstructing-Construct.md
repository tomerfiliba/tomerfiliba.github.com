[As I've said before](http://tomerfiliba.com/blog/Construct-Plans)

## Motivation ##


## Syntax ##


## Compilation ##
In the days of [psyco](http://psyco.sourceforge.net/), we were able to gain a x10 speed boost simply by enabling
psyco's JIT compilation. These days are go, however, and it doesn't seem like anyone will be picking it up again.



## Construct 2.5 ##
And a word on Construct 2.5 - I've taken care of most of the issues. The main task now is to write the new site 
and update the docs.
