Dynamic programming languages are ill-defined in general, but some common traits they hold include the ability to
modify their code-flow in runtime (code isn't fixed in compiled time) and a dynamic type system that can "lifts"
the constraints of well-known, static type systems. C, as we all know, is as static as it gets: not only does
it compile and type-check, but it loses all type information in runtime. For instance, C++ has RTTI, Java has
reflection, but types in C boil down to cold-blooded pointer-arithmetic. You had a ``struct address``? Too bad,
your ``street`` field is now a pointer at ``EBP+12``.

On the other hand, of course, dynamic languages pay in memory consumption and performance, as they leave everything
for resolution in runtime. Wouldn't it be nice to have features like ``getattr`` or creating classes in runtime,
but have performance comparable to static languages? Well, you can. It's called **code generation**.

Code generation? We're doing it for ages, what's new here?

## Going Meta with Code Generation ##

Allow me to begin with an observation: code generation is mostly required in static languages. For instance,


Observation: we use code generation mostly in static languages; dynamic languages can simply overcome it

Nothing new so far





For a project I'm working on, I developed a framework
