## Style != Beauty ##

Lastly, I wanted to point out that **coding style is not just about looks**. Many people think that
style is a matter of individual preference; it might be true, but it usually reflects

if x in somedict.keys()
if kwargs.keys()[0] == 'foo'

try:
    x
except:
    raise

self.MUST_BE_SINGLE_PATH is True

divmod(offset, 512)[0]
