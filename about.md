Some background: I'm 26 years old, married, living in Tel Aviv. I'll be graduating this year from 
the Tel Aviv University, where I study Computer Science and Generative Linguistics (aiming at
the vicinity of [computational linguistics](http://xkcd.com/114/)). I currently 
work for [IBM XIV](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/xiv/), where I serve as a technical 
focal point and do all sorts of stuff, mostly in the fields of RPC, automation, and design 
methodologies.

Computers and I go a long way back; I started with *QBasic* on DOS at the age of 10, where I
got an intimate acquaintance with the low-level world, and from there I climbed up to more modern
languages and environments. Today my arsenal includes of nearly every popular language (C, 
C++, Java, C#, VB.NET) and platform (Linux/POSIX, Windows) at a very high level of proficiency -- 
but my specialty is none other than Python. I've been a proud *pythonista* since 2003, and it's 
been my language of choice ever since; I've also contributed code to the interpreter, and was 
actively involved in the development of the language. Other than programming per-se, I also have 
extensive knowledge of operating system internals, file systems and network protocols.

On the one hand, I come from the pragmatic side of getting things done and refraining from academic
yadda-yadda, but I'm also very much into theoretic stuff. Less of an algorithmic-kind-of-person,
I'm mostly concerned with computational theory, computational models and their expressive power,
and [abstract algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory). I'm in the process of 
(every-so-slowly) learning [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/), an experience I consider life-changing.
Haskell has taught me a lot about programming methodologies and the power of generalization; 
in fact, I try to implement many of the concepts I learn there in other languages -- 
being practical, again.

My fields of interest today include 
[Domain Specific Languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specific_languages),
in the form of in-language [combinators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinators) (for instance, 
parsing or UI combinators); transparent networking; experimental operating systems (such as 
[Singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_(operating_system%29));
[reactive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern) programming using 
[coroutines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) (versus the non-scalable multithreaded 
approach); and generally, finding better ways to automate and generalize mundane tasks. 

On my less geeky side, I enjoy (at no particular order): hanging around good people, 
reading books (mostly fiction), traveling the world, beer and wine, music (ranges from Fiona Apple
to *Tool*), learning new random things (spending hours wandering around Wikipedia),
working out, Italian cooking (and Italy in general), growing plants, xkcd, and my lovely wife.
