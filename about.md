Some background: I'm 26 years old, married, living in Tel Aviv. I'll be graduating this year from 
the Tel Aviv University, where I study Computer Science and Generative Linguistics (aiming at
the vicinity of [computational linguistics](http://xkcd.com/114/)). I currently 
work for [IBM XIV](http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/storage/disk/xiv/), where I serve as a technical 
focal point and do all sorts of stuff, mostly in the fields of RPC, automation, and architecture.

Computers and I go a long way back; I started with QBasic on DOS at the age of 10, where I
got an intimate acquaintance with the low-level world, and from there I climbed up to more modern
languages and environments. 

Today I have extensive knowledge of operating system internals and 
network protocols, and my arsenal includes nearly all of the popular languages (C, C++,
Java, C#, VB.NET) and platforms (Linux/POSIX, Windows) at a very high level of proficiency -- but
my specialty is none other than Python. I've been a pythonista since 2004, and it's been my main
language since then; I've also contributed code to the interpreter, and was actively involved in
the development of the language.

On the one hand, I come from the pragmatic side of getting things done and refraining from academic
yadda-yadda, but I'm also very much into theoretic stuff. Less of an algorithmic-kind-of-person,
I'm mostly concerned with computational theory, computational models and their expressive power,
and [abstract algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_theory). I'm in the process of 
(every-so-slowly) learning [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/), an experience I consider life-changing.
Haskell has taught me a lot about programming methodologies and the power of generalization; 
in fact, I try to implement many of the concepts I learn there in other languages (being practical, 
again).

My fields of interest today include [Domain Specific Languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_specific_languages),
in the form of in-language [combinators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinators) (for instance, 
parsing or UI combinators); transparent networking; [reactive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern)
programming using [coroutines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) versus the non-scalable
multithreaded approach; and generally, finding better ways to automate and generalize mundane 
tasks (they all break the DRY principle). I'm also a huge fan of Wikipedia and 
[github](http://github.com).

On my less geeky side, I enjoy reading books (mostly fiction), hanging around good people,
traveling the world, beer, and wine.
